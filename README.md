# Personal Website

See it in [action](https://danv.me),

- Inspired by [r3nanp's](https://github.com/r3nanp/me) own personal website.
- HTML & CSS only.
- Most of the icons are either favicons or actual logos, all batch-resized using [redketchup.io](https:/redketchup.io), while just a few are from Fontawesome.
- Font used: Overused Grotesk via [CDNfont](https://www.cdnfonts.com/overused-grotesk.font)

To Do:
- clean unused stuff
- reduce logo css classes down to a few (they were added over time, all logos were of different sizes thus each warranted different padding values)
